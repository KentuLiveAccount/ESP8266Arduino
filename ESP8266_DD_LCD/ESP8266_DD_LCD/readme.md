Wemos D1 mini

use voltage divider to send 1.65v, and use the transition from -1.65v to 1.65v which exceeds the 3volt swing enough to enable a segment.

once scanning is enabled, 3volt delta doesn't get applied to each segment long enough to be able to put enough contrast.

rigth now, doing animation, enabling one segment at a time.
